# Major Recurring NPCs

## Bartholomew, Talking Skull 

A talking skull bought by Coil from Karshala. How he became a talking skull is unknown, but it is likely the work of a necromancer. He is fully aware of his predicament and desires to travel with the Party.

## Valse, Hobson's Patron 

Valse seems to have lived in Orlon years ago as part of an adventuring group. His memories are shrouded in mystery. He currently lives in the silver bracer on Hobson's arm, which allows him to control Hobson if he so desires. His greatest desire is to get a statue of himself, which is why he is bonded with Hobson.

# Other NPCs

Organized by Faction, if available.

## Unnamed Assassin Guild

### Duzrevur, Assassin Guild Head 

Presumably the head of the Assassin's guild that Morenthal and Molloke are a part of. It is unclear what he thinks of everything going on.

### Molloke Iron, Assassin 

A bounty hunter and assassin presumably from the same guild as Morenthal. He wants to capture/kill Feyli, as there is 24,000 gp bounty on her head. However, he warned Morenthal of the impending bounty first.

## Factionless/One-Offs

### Dave, Necromancer 

An incompetent necromancer and part of the Black Hand group. He was hiding in the Nightmother temple's catacombs doing necromancy stuff. 

### Durmin, FFXIV reference 

Durmin Durami is the name of Dan Floyd's Final Fantasy XIV Lalafell for his PlayFrame series. He has absolutely nothing to do with the D&D campaign, but Lalafells and Halflings share a similar role as small races.
