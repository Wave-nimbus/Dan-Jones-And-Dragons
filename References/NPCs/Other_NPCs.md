# Major NPCs

## Bartholomew, Talking Skull

A talking skull bought by Coil from Karshala. How he became a talking skull is unknown, but it is likely the work of a necromancer. He is fully aware of his predicament and desires to travel with the Party.

## Valss, Hobson's Patron

Valss seems to have lived in Orlon years ago as part of an adventuring group. His memories are shrouded in mystery, but he gets flashes in the Flesh Cave. He currently lives in the silver bracer on Hobson's arm, which allows him to control Hobson if he so desires. His greatest desire is to get a statue of himself, which is why he is bonded with Hobson.

# Others

## Daemon, Guild Head

Presumably the head of the Bloodletters guild that Morenthal and Molloke are a part of. It is unclear what he thinks of everything going on.

## Dave, Necromancer

An incompetant necromancer and part of the Black Hand group. He was hiding in the Nightmother temple's catacombs doing necromancy stuff. 

## Durmin, FFXIV reference

Durmin Durami is the name of Dan Floyd's Final Fantasy XIV Lalafell for his PlayFrame series. He has absolutely nothing to do with the D&D campagin, but Lalafells and Halflings share a similar role as small races.

## Me, Mushroom Man

A mushroom creature the Party encountered in the Underdark. Part of a race of enormous mushroom creatures that eat creatures that stay inside their muschroom hill cavern. Otherwise quite firendly.

## Molloke Iron, Assassin

A bounty hunter and assassin presumably from the same Bloodletters guild as Morenthal. He wants to caputre/kill Feyli, as there is 24,000 gp bounty on her head. However, he warned Morenthal of the impending bounty first.

## Yuul Greaterfist, Assassin?

A member of the Bloodletters that Morenthal notices after returning from getting Void gear ordered. Yuul does not usually take marks, so it is strange for him to be in Filgrove.
