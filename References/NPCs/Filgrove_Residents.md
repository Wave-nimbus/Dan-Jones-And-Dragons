# Notable Filgrove Residents

## Karashala, the Hag

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations. She has made deals that resulted in holding onto Gelnek's soul in a Soul Orb.

# Trilby's Family

## Melinda Hornsfarrow, Mom

Melinda is a stern but caring mother. She worries about Trilby only when Trilby leaves for long periods of time without notifying her. Otherwise, she supports Trilby's adventures, since she and Facetious cannot really stop him.

## Facetious Hornsfarrow, Dad

Facetious was a Crown's Guard member until an injury to his leg forced him out of action for a time. He is gracious though stern with his children. It is ambiguous if he approves or disapproves of Trilby's adventures. He shares the same sentiment that Trilby should inform his parents of any extended travels, however.

## Dora & Derby Hornsfarrow, Siblings

Little is known about Trilby's siblings other than their names. It seems like they tease Trilby occasionally, but they listen to their parents.
