# Notable Filgrove Residents

## Berckley Teldonto, Duke of Filgrove |

A Dwarf noble that is extrmely well kept and well spoken. He likes to hear himself talk, and he tends to exaggerate the deeds of others, taking credit for hiring the Party. He seems competant enough, and friendly otherwise.

## Hestio, Green Raven Leader

The de facto leader of the Green Ravens was first impressed by the Party taking down the Manticore. Since then, he has seen the Party as a capable bunch, and he extended an invitation into the Green Raven's ranks for them. He and Borey are the Party's go-tos for any authorities. He is also the best at breaking down monster parts into useable items.

## Karshala, the Hag

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations.

## Ficesious Hornsferrow, Dad

Ficesious was a Crown's Guard member until an injury to his leg forced him out of action for a time. He is gracious though stern with his children.
