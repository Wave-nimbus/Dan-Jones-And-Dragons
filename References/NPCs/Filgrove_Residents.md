# Notable Filgrove Residents

## Berkley Teldonto, Duke of Filgrove 

A Dwarf noble that is extremely well kept and well spoken. He likes to hear himself talk, and he tends to exaggerate the deeds of others, taking credit for hiring the Party. He seems competent enough, and friendly otherwise.

## Bori Unzar, Crown's Guard Captain

A Dwarf that previously was pestered constantly by Trilby. He acts as the captain of Filgrove's Crown's Guard. He was also friends/captain of Trilby's father before the father got injured. He commissions the Party to do a few jobs when available.

## Gavel, Tavern Keep

The keeper of the Brass Squid tavern. He is grateful for the Party saving Derrick at their beginnings. From then on, his tavern has always welcomed the Party with a room and good food for resting.

## Hestio, Green Raven Leader

The de facto leader of the Green Ravens was first impressed by the Party taking down the Manticore. Since then, he has seen the Party as a capable bunch, and he extended an invitation into the Green Raven's ranks for them. He and Bori are the Party's go-tos for any authorities. He is also the best at breaking down monster parts into usable items.

## Karashala, the Hag

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations.

# Green Ravens

## CC (Cubaricubari), Secretary

A Bugbear who serves at the head desk of the Green Raven's HQ. She keeps track of rewards, hunts, and posters. She also knows a lot about each beast's weaknesses.

## Graster, Hunter

Good muscle and tank for any hunting party. A lycanthrope that has accepted his condition. During a fight, he bit Trayton of the Burning Spears, infecting him. The Party cured him of the curse after he was banished from Filgrove.

## Uldar Mineswept, Blacksmith

Once Hestio strips a monster for its parts, Uldar is in charge of forging it into something useful.

## Shana, Chef

Able to create various rations and meals out of monster parts, some of which may give useful effects.

## Tane, Tracker

The one in charge of tracking beasts during a hunt.

## Vera, Alchemist

The potion master capable of most anything that is required for hunting beasts. She also can create tranquilizing potions if the Green Ravens need them.

# Store Employees

## [Unnamed], Blacksmith

Female Dwarven blacksmith that owns and operates The Steel Workbench. For an inexplicable reason, Gelnek is terrified of her.

# Trilby's Family 

## Melina Hornsfarrow, Mom

Melina is a stern but caring mother. She worries about Trilby only when Trilby leaves for long periods of time without notifying her. Otherwise, she supports Trilby's adventures, since she and Facetious cannot really stop him.

## Facetious Hornsfarrow, Dad

Facetious was a Crown's Guard member until an injury to his leg forced him out of action for a time. He is gracious though stern with his children. It is ambiguous if he approves or disapproves of Trilby's adventures. He shares the same sentiment that Trilby should inform his parents of any extended travels, however.

## Dora & Derby Hornsfarrow, Siblings

Little is known about Trilby's siblings other than their names. It seems like they tease Trilby occasionally, but they listen to their parents. 

# Other Residents

## Han Rothenel, Burning Spear

Mentioned in Session 1, but met in Session 7, Han is a prominent member in the Burning Spear group in Filgrove. He made a deal with the Party for them to find Trayton Farkle, bringing him back alive or letting him go if Trayton wanted out.

## Meribeth, Rescued Crowns' Guard

A member of the Crown's Guard that was rescued in the Flesh Cave. She was rescued before being fully absorbed by the Flesh Cave.

## Utto, Duke's Assistant 

A harried and greasy Gnome that is the personal assistant to Duke Teldonto. Not much is known about him other than his appearance.
