# Notable Filgrove Residents

## Bori Unzar, Crown's Guard Captain 

A Dwarf that previously was pestered constantly by Trilby. He acts as the captain of Filgrove's Crown's Guard. He was also friends/captain of Trilby's father before the father got injured. He commissions the Party to do a few jobs when available.

## Karashala, the Hag

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations.

## Bill Redshirt, Minor Miner

A guide for the tunnel between Filgrove and Geria that would surely die if the Party failed to protect him.
