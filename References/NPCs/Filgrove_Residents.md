# Notable Filgrove Residents

## The Duke 

Presumably the regional ruler for Filgrove and the surrounding areas. Bori says he can get the Party a favor from him if requested.

## Bori Unzar, Crown's Guard Captain 

A Dwarf that previously was pestered constantly by Trilby. He acts as the captain of Filgrove's Crown's Guard. He was also friends/captain of Trilby's father before the father got injured. He commissions the Party to do a few jobs when available.

## Gavel, Tavern Keep 

The keeper of the Brass Squid tavern. He is grateful for the Party saving Derrick at their beginnings. From then on, his tavern has always welcomed the Party with a room and good food for resting.

## Hestio, Green Raven Leader 

The de facto leader of the Green Ravens was first impressed by the Party taking down the Manticore. Since then, he has seen the Party as a capable bunch, and he extended an invitation into the Green Raven's ranks for them. He and Bori are the Party's go-tos for any authorities. He is also the best at breaking down monster parts into useable items.

## Karashala, the Hag 

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations.

Good muscle and tank for any hunting party. If the Party wants assistance in a monster hunt, Graster is good for extra muscle.
