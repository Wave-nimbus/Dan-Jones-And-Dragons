# Notable Filgrove Residents

## Berkley Teldonto, Duke of Filgrove 

A Dwarf noble that is extremely well kept and well spoken. He likes to hear himself talk, and he tends to exaggerate the deeds of others, taking credit for hiring the Party. He seems competent enough, and friendly otherwise.

## Karashala, the Hag

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations.
