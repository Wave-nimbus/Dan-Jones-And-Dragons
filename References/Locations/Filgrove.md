## Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures take shape. It is home to several services that the Party utilizes, and it is looked over by the Crown's Guard and the Green Ravens. Although not much happens around the city, both groups are looking for additional help constnatly. Notable locations in and around Filgrove include the following:

### Bits and Bobbles 

A pawn shop run by Biggleton Whipersnap. Trilby is given the Bag of Many Things covered by the Brass Puzzle by Whipersnap.

### The Brass Squid 

The Party's main tavern where they all first met. It is headed by Gavel along with his employees Derrick and Mera. Gavel is happy to accommodate the Party after they saved Derrick from the Manticore. This place is a safe haven where the Party can rest, get rations and eat good food.

### The Crown's Guard Tower

One of the offices of the Crown's Guard that serves the city. Usually manned by Bori. The Crown's Guard is stretched thin this far North, so Bori is appreciative of any help the Party can give him. 

### The Crown's Guard Barracks

The Barracks of the Crown's Guard serve as the return location for the Orbs of Recall. Said Orbs were used in the retrieval of the Relic Staff. It is tall enough to accommodate Airship docking. It has a fancy meeting room on one of its upper floors.

### The Grayhorn Farm 

One of the two main farms outside of town. It is run solely by Terry Grayhorn after his son Bren Grayhorn went missing. Due to the lack of funds and help, the farm is slowly being out-done by the Mosswing farm. They are famous for carrots, though they farm all kinds of produce.

### The Green Ravens' Headquarters 

The monster hunting Green Ravens have set themselves up here. It is where they eat, sleep, prepare for hunts, and salvage items from their other hunts. The Party is offered space in the HQ thanks to their services to Filgrove as a whole. Monster hunts can be exchanged for money or forged into gear. 

### The Mosswing Farm 

One of the two main farms outside of town. It is headed by Gale Mosswing, who managed to greatly improve his crop production. Unfortunately, this was through the use of dark magics and necromancy. This resulted in the Missing People incident.

### The Serpent's Flower 

This alchemist's store is run solely by Gemma Elm, though her daughter Joyce also used to work there. Various potions can be bought here once the Party gets enough money, including a sleeping drought for Hobson. 

### The Steel Workbench

The blacksmith shop run by an unnamed female Dwarf. Gelnek purchases a chain shirt from the shop, and is inexplicably scared of her.

### The Undercroft 

The Undercroft serves as the slums for Filgrove. It is located under the city, though it is nicer than the sewers. The notable resident here is Karashala the Hag, who deals in information and magical trinkets. Furthermore, a tunnel to Geria starts down here.

### What's Mine is Mine 

The miners of Filgrove are headed by Pibbly Glimsby, and they serve to gather resources around the town. Their services were also requested by the Crown's Guard to map the tunnels to Geria.
