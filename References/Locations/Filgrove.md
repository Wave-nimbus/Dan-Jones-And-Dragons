## Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures take shape. It is home to several services that the Party utilizes, and it is looked over by the Crown's Guard and the Green Ravens. Although not much happens around the city, both groups are looking for additional help constantly. Notable locations in and around Filgrove include the following:

### The Brass Squid

The Party's main tavern where they all first met. It is headed by Gavel along with his employees Derrick and Mera. Gavel is happy to accommodate the Party after they saved Derrick from the Manticore. This place is a safe haven where the Party can rest, get rations and eat good food.

### The Grayhorn Farm 

One of the two main farms outside of town. It is run solely by Terry Grayhorn after his son Bren Grayhorn went missing. Due to the lack of funds and help, the farm is slowly being out-done by the Mosswing farm. They are famous for carrots, though they farm all kinds of produce.

### The Mosswing Farm 

One of the two main farms outside of town. It is headed by Gale Mosswing, who managed to greatly improve his crop production. Unfortunately, this was through the use of dark magics and necromancy. This resulted in the Missing People incident.
