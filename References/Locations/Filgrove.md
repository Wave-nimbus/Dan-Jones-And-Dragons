## Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures take shape. It is home to several services that the Party utilizes, and it is looked over by the Crown's Guard and the Green Ravens. Although not much happens around the city, both groups are looking for additional help constnatly. Notable locations in and around Filgrove include the following:

### The Brass Squid

The Party's main tavern where they all first met. It is headed by Gavel along with his employees Derek and Merra. Gavel is happy to accomodate the Party after they saved Derek from the Manticore. This place is a safe haven where the Party can rest, get rations and eat good food.

### The Crown's Guard Tower

One of the offices of the Crown's Guard that serves the city. Usually manned by Borey. The Crown's Guard is stretched thin this far North, so Borey is appreciative of any help the Party can give him. 

### The Crown's Guard Barracks

The Barracks of the Crown's Guard serve as the return location for the Orbs of Recall. Said orbs were used in the retrieval of the Relic Staff. It is tall enough to accomodate Airship docking. It has a fancy meeting room on one of its upper floors.

### The Green Raven's Headquarters

The monster hunting Green Ravens have set themselves up here. It is where they eat, sleep, prepare for hunts, and salvage items from their other hunts. The Party is offered space in the HQ thanks to their services to Filgrove as a whole. Monster hunts can be exchanged for money or forged into gear. 

### The Steel Workbench 

The blacksmith shop run by an unnamed female Dwarf. Gelnek purchases a chain shirt from the shop, and is inexplicably scared of her.

### The Undercroft

The Undercroft serves as the slums for Filgrove. It is located under the city, though it is nicer than the sewers. The notable resident here is Karshala the Hag, who deals in information and magical trinkets. Furthermore, a tunnel to Geria starts down here.
