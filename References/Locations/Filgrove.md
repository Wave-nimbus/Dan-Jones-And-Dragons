## Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures take shape. It is home to several services that the Party utilizes, and it is looked over by the Crown's Guard and the Green Ravens. Although not much happens around the city, both groups are looking for additional help constnatly. Notable locations in and around Filgrove include the following:

### The Crown's Guard Barracks

The Barracks of the Crown's Guard serve as the return location for the Orbs of Recall. Said orbs were used in the retrieval of the Relic Staff. It is tall enough to accomodate Airship docking. It has a fancy meeting room on one of its upper floors.

### The Undercroft

The Undercroft serves as the slums for Filgrove. It is located under the city, though it is nicer than the sewers. The notable resident here is Karshala the Hag, who deals in information and magical trinkets. Furthermore, a tunnel to Geria starts down here.
