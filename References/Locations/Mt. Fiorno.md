## Mt. Fiorno

Mt. Fiorno is the name of both the volcano and town within the Ashen Highlands. The volcano houses a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire known as the Rift of Fire. Its population is primarily made of Fire Genasi and Tieflings. The surrounding area is covered by the Voscorie Bog, which slowly grows over time.

### Voscorie Bog

The Voscorie Bog stretches from the Gulf to the base of the mountains of the Ashen Highlands. It grows unnaturally, kept at bay from entering Mt. Fiorno by a moat of fire maintained by the town. The Ustenki tribe call the Bog its nomadic home.

### Rift of Fire

The portal from the Material Plane to the Elemental Plane of Fire. It is guarded 24/7 by the residents of Mt. Fiorno. This portal is why the town has such strong attunement to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

### Sunken Castle of Ol'Lui

A fortress or keep that was consumed by the Voscorie Bog. A Beholder known as the Eyedra claimed it as its base, enthralling several monsters & humanoids to guard it.
