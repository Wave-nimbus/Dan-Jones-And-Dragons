## Lafford

A small village of only about 500 people in the Northwest of Orlon. The most recent usage of the Flower of Rebirth occured a few miles North of the town proper aproximately 4 months before the Party visited it. The town itself was hit hard by the Ashen Rot plague, likely caused by a zombie in their well. Clerics to Ophena have helped the town recover from the plague. The Black Hand's Headquarters is a few miles south. More information on the town and surrounding area is below.

### Black Hand Headquarters

Found a few miles south of town and hidden by a lever inside a rock, the HQ of the Black Hand is not easily found. It has several amenities that all necromancer cults need, including torture chambers, altars to The First, dormatories, kitchens, and mess halls. People outside the cult who view the entrance are put to death. The base was gutted by The Second's attempt to revive The First.

#### The First's Shrine

Deep within the Black Hand's HQ lies the grave of The First. It is usually covered by an altar and was previously worshiped by the Black Hand before The Second killed them in an attempt to revive the First. A special key and high status are required to enter the shrine's room.

### The Cracked Flagon

The small tavern found within Lafford. Its tavernkeep is currently unnamed, and due to the Ashen Rot plague, it is barely able to sustain itself. It is also where members of the Illustrious Delight hang out when awaiting orders.
