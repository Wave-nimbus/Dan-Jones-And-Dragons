## Lafford

A small village of only about 500 people in the Northwest of Orlon. The most recent usage of the Flower of Rebirth occurred a few miles North of the town proper approximately 4 months before the Party visited it. The town itself was hit hard by the Ashen Rot plague, likely caused by a zombie in their well. Clerics to Ophena have helped the town recover from the plague. The Black Hand's Headquarters is a few miles south.
