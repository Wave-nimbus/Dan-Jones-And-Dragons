# The World of E'lythia

Presumed to be what the world for this campaign is called. There appear to be multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'lythia. Orlon is one such continent.

# The Continent of Orlon

Not much has been revealed about the continent as a whole. It is controlled by an Empire. Smaller sections or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Most of the Party's initial adventures take place in the North of Orlon, around Filgrove.

## Major Cities/Locations

### Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures took shape. See the Filgrove reference for more information.

### The Flesh Cave

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Staff of Defilement was found here and used unsuccessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

## Minor Cities/Locations

### Brightcoin

A major city on the continent of Orlon. It is home to the Vaults of Eversteel, though little else is known about it

### Evertree 

Almost nothing is known about this other than its name. Morenthal's Purging Dagger from the Chameleonaire apparently comes from this tree.

### Maple 

A town to the Southeast where Hobson's family lives. Maple Farms is a brand of wine. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Morfield 

A town not too far to the south of Filgrove. It appears to be the most recent stop for the Illustrious Delight before they went to Filgrove.

### Northcliff

A presumably floating city on account of Green Void Crystals. It is south of Filgrove, and it serves as the HQ of the Council of E'lythia.

### Silverfell 

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. Hobson was originally supposed to join the college as an administrator before meeting Valse.

## Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world of E'lythia. The Council of E'lythia has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Void Cave 

A large cave filled with Void Crystals that was home to the Void Snail. It is about 2 days travel to the West of Filgrove. The Party killed the Void Snail, taking chunks back to create new items.

## Other Regions

### The Shard Coast

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here. Whoever put the bounty on Morenthal is in this area.

### Shariza

Presumably a large town across the East Sea (which means it may not be on Orlon proper). It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Almost nothing is known about it otherwise.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, treacherous journeys.

## Major Events

### The War in the West

A bloody conflict presumably taking place on the western side of Orlon. According to Adokas, it is a stalemate and on pause while the artifacts are being retrieved.

### Explosion at the Vaults of Eversteel

An attack of some kind on Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It scattered dozens of extremely powerful magical artifacts across the world. The Council of E'lythia is attempting to recover them before something terrible can happen.
