# The World of E'lythia

The name of the world for this campaign is set in. There are multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'lythia. Orlon is one such continent. Other continents include Ty'vanera and Djoria.

# The Continent of Orlon

Orlon is the main continent that the campaign takes place on. It is controlled by an Empire, ruled by Leofrick Roseark. Smaller regions or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Generally, the Empire is at peace with everyone, though this was not always the case.

## Visited Locations/Cities

### Ashen Highlands 

A volcanic region in the Southernmost part of Orlon. The nearby volcano, Mt. Fiorno, renders it close to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Thus, it was the location of the Ring of Flame, one of the 10 Artifacts.

### Filgrove 

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures took shape. See the Filgrove reference for more information.

### Mt. Fiorno 

A town in the south of Orlon within the Ashen Highlands. The Ring of Flame was discovered by a resident before being taken to the nearby Voscorie Bog. See the Mt. Fiorno reference for more details.

### Northcliff 

Northcliff is a technologically advanced city that serves as a central hub for the search for the 10 Artifacts. It used to be home of the Champions of Virtue before they disbanded. It floats high above the ground on Green Void Crystals. Northcliff is near the Southwestern edge of Orlon. See the Northcliff reference for more details.

### Ohkross 

A village north of Northcliff. When the Party first sees it, it is being raided by Bloodletter bandits. It is also the home of Everit Darwin.

## Mentioned Cities/Locations

### Blackfane 

A large and major city in central Orlon. It serves as an enormous trade and merchant hub, with nearly anything being available to buy. It appears as a massive black spire with boardwalks running out a distance from the main spire. The Emperor of E'lythia is also housed in this city.

### Brightcoin

A major city on the continent of Orlon. It is home to the Vaults of Eversteel, though little else is known about it. It's ruled by a king named Rylen Lendsborough.

### Desert of Thorns 

A large desert in Eastern Orlon. The Gauntlet of the Eye, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be somewhere in this desert.

### Far Reach Mountains 

A mountain range that extends across most of the northern reaches of Orlon. It is most easily traversed by airship, though it houses several flying creatures including wyverns that are capable and willing of attack such airships.

### Geria 

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft. The Champions previously killed a powerful monster here.

### Maple 

A town to the Southeast where Hobson's family lives. Maple Farms is a brand of wine. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Ravenmire 

A town even further North than Filgrove. It was the site of the lich Xerafax's base of operations. That event caused the town's population to be razed nearly to a man. The town has since never recovered and is barely surviving.

### Riverleaf 

A town mostly populated by Druids somewhere in Orlon. It was the site of an interplanar rift between the Material and Feywild Planes. The Champions helped close the rift, and due to Valse's actions on the Feywild side, he was inducted into the group.

### The Shard Coast 

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here. Whoever put the bounty on Morenthal is in this area. Despite being a large area, it is considered a single city.

### Silverfell 

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. That college is headed by Gregor Timbers, one of the Champions of Virtue. Hobson originally was an administrator for the college before getting his bracer with Valse. The package the bracer came in was likely originally addressed to Gregor.

### Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world of E'lythia. The Council of E'lythia has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Westmont 

A town in the South of Orlon. Some years ago, Arther Oathbringer reappeared with a flying castle and an army over the town. 

# The Continent of Ty'vanera 

(TY-ven-err-ah) A continent separate from Orlon where beast tribes have gathered to form a coalition style government. Little else is known about it, including where exactly it is.

## Mentioned Towns/Locations

### Bluelake 

A town on the West edge of Ty'vanera. The Flower of Rebirth was used & recovered here before being transferred to the Vaults of Eversteel. Lady Belle found ALt-Valse's gauntlet near here. Other than that, nothing is known about it.

### The Citadel 

A large castle structure in the center of Whitecrest. It serves as the world's most complete archive and hub for knowledge. The Flower of Rebirth was kept there temporarily before being transferred to the Vaults of Eversteel.

### Whitecrest 

A major city on the Western edge of Ty'Vanera. It houses The Citadel, a knowledge hub of the world. Lady Belle and Vindilay made contact with Hobson here first.

# Major Events

### Explosion at the Vaults of Eversteel 

An attack of some kind on Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It scattered dozens of extremely powerful magical artifacts across the world. The 10 most powerful artifacts are being hotly pursued by the Council of E'lythia. The Explosion took place approximately 6 months before the campaign began.

### The Tusk Wars

Presumably a series of battles fought in the North of Orlon. The Champion of Virtue, V, gained his reputation and stature by fighting and eventually ending these wars. Little else is known about them.

## Travel Network

### The Airship Viridescent Javelin  

The first Airship of the campaign that takes the Party from Filgrove south to Northcliff over the course of four days. It is a large flying ship held aloft by six large Green Void Crystals. Its weaponry includes six ballistas, which can be used to attack flying or grounded enemies off of the ship. The ship is at the Party's disposal for their hunt for the 10 Artifacts. Its crew is listed in the NPC references.
