# The World of E'lythia

The name of the world for this campaign is set in. There are multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'lythia. Orlon is one such continent. Other continents include Ty'vanera and Djoria.

# The Continent of Orlon

Orlon is the main continent that the campaign takes place on. It is controlled by an Empire, ruled by Leofrick Ozark. Smaller regions or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Generally, the Empire is at peace with everyone, though this was not always the case.

## Visited Locations/Cities

### Ashen Highlands 

A volcanic region in the Southernmost part of Orlon. The nearby volcano, Mt. Fiorno, renders it close to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Thus, it was the location of the Ring of Flame, one of the 10 Artifacts.

### Filgrove 

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures took shape. See the Filgrove reference for more information.

### The Flesh Cave 

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Staff of Defilement was found here and used unsuccessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

### Lafford 

A town in the Northwest of Orlon. The Flower of Rebirth, one of the 10 Artifacts, was most recently used here. The town is notable for being the headquarters of the Black Hand necromancy cult. See the Lafford reference for more details.

### Mt. Fiorno 

A town in the south of Orlon within the Ashen Highlands. The Ring of Flame was discovered by a resident before being taken to the nearby Voscorie Bog. See the Mt. Fiorno reference for more details.

### Northcliff 

Northcliff is a technologically adavanced city that serves as a central hub for the search for the 10 Artifacts. It used to be home of the Champions of Virtue before they disbanded. It floats high above the ground on Green Void Crystals. Northcliff is near the Southwestern edge of Orlon. See the Northcliff reference for more details.

The inn/tavern at Ohkross run by Effie the Gnome. It is a small establishment, but the Party is welcome there.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, treacherous journeys.

## Mentioned Cities/Locations

### Blackfane

### The Shard Coast 

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon.
