# The World of E'lithia |

The name of the world for this campaign is set in. There are multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'lithia. Orlon is one such continent. Other continents include Tievenera and Djoria.

# The Continent of Orlon |

Orlon is the main continent that the campaign takes place on. It is controlled by an Empire, ruled by Leofrick Ozark. Smaller regions or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Generally, the Empire is at peace with everyone, though this was not always the case.

## Visited Locations/Cities

### Filgrove |

Filgrove is where the Party spent their early days. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. See the Filgrove reference for more details.

### The Flesh Cave |

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Staff of Defilement was found here and used unsucessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

### Northcliff |

Northcliff is a technologically adavanced city that serves as a central hub for the search for the 10 Artifacts. It used to be home of the Champions of Virtue before they disbanded. It floats high above the ground on Green Void Crystals. Northcliff is near the Southwestern edge of Orlon. See the Northcliff reference for more details.

### Ohkross |

A village north of Northcliff. When the Party first see it, it is being raided by Bloodletter bandits. It was also the home of Everit Darwin.

#### The Mossy Castle |

The inn/tavern at Ohkross run by Effy the Gnome. It is a small establishment, but the Party is welcome there.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, trecherous journeys.

## Mentioned Cities/Locations

### Ashen Highlands

A volcanic region somewhere on the continent of Orlon. The nearby volcano renders it close to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Thus, it is the likely location of the Ring of Flame, one of the 10 Artifacts.

### Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel |

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world of E'lithia. The Council of E'lithia has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Desert of Thorns |

A large desert somewhere on Orlon. The Gauntlet of the Eye, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be somewhere in this desert.

### Dragonhold |

A city somewhere in Orlon, presumably with a large population of dragons or draconic relatives. It is under lockdown until The Amber Dragon Eye, on of the 10 Artifacts, can be secured.

### Far Reach Mountains |

A mountain range that extends across most of the northern reaches of Orlon. It is most easily traversed by airship, though it houses several flying creatures including wyverns that are capable and willing ot attack such airships.

### Lafford |

A town somewhere on the continent of Orlon. The Flower of Rebirth, one of the 10 Artifacts, was most recently used here. The town is notable for being the headquarters of the Black Hand necromancy cult. 

### Morfield |

A town not too far to the south of Filgrove. It appears to be the most recent stop for the Illustrious Delight before they went to Filgrove.

### Rycefall |

A town near the Sunken City of Cera, which serves as a adventuring and archeology hub. Beyond that, almost nothing is known about it.

### Shoreza |

A large island in the South of Orlon that has strange and strong effects on magic. Many years ago, the Champions of Virtue killed a Lich here. Arther Oathbringer's castle crashed here when Valss and Orsik Frostbeard went to investigate. No expedition to the island has beens successful since. The Planar Mirror, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be there.

### Silverhill |

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. That college is headed by Gregor Timbers, one of the Champions of Virtue. Hobson originally was an administrator for the college before getting his bracer with Valss. The package the bracer came in was likely originally addressed to Gregor.

### Springoak |

A town on the Western edge of Orlon. Horace Devenshire is known as the Wizard of the White Tower and hails from this town. Hobson is likely a wanted man there thanks to Valss.

### Sunken City of Cera |

The ruins of the Voedia civilization. These ruins are the most likely origin of Coil, as similar Nobility Cera models of Warforged have been discovered on delves into the city's ruins.

### Varo'El |

A small island presumably in the South of Orlon. It is currently under siege by The Heart of the Keep, one of the 10 Artifacts.

### Wildwin

A town somewhere on the continent of Tievenera. The Wand of Chaos, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be here.

The first Airship of the campaign that takes the Party from Filgrove south to Northcliff over the course of four days. It is a large flying ship held aloft by six large Green Void Crystals.

Its crew is listed in the NPC references.
