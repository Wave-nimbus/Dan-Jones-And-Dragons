# The World of E'E'lithia

Presumed to be what the world for this campaign is called. There appear to be multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'E'lithia. Orlon is one such continent.

# The Continent of Orlon

Not much has been revealed about the continent as a whole. It is controlled by an Empire. Smaller sections or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Most of the Party's initial adventures take place in the North of Orlon, around Filgrove.

## Major Cities/Locations

### Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures took shape. See the Filgrove reference for more information.

### The Flesh Cave

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Staff of Defilement was found here and used unsucessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

## Minor Cities/Locations

### Blackfane

A large and major city in central Orlon. It serves as an enormous trade and merchent hub, with nearly anything being available to buy. It appears as a massive black spire with boardwalks running out a distance from the main spire. The Emperor of E'E'lithia is also housed in this city.

### Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world of E'lithia. The Council of E'lithia has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Evertree

Almost nothing is known about this other than its name. Morenthal's Purging Dagger from the Chamillionare apparently comes from this tree.

### Far Reach Mountains

A mountain range that extends across most of the northern reaches of Orlon. It is most easily traversed by airship, though it houses several flying creatures including wyverns that are capable and willing ot attack such airships.

### Geria

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft.

### Maple

A town to the Southeast where Hobson's family lives. Maple Farms is a brand of wine. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Morfield

A town not too far to the south of Filgrove. It appears to be the most recent stop for the Illustrious Delight before they went to Filgrove.

### Northcliff

A presumably floating city on account of Green Void Crystals. It is south of Filgrove, and it serves as the HQ of the Council of E'lithia.

### Ohkross

A village north of Northcliff. When the Party first sees it, the town appears to be on fire, so they investigate it.

### Ravenmire

A town even further North than Filgrove. Even less happens there, so almost nothing is known.

### Rycefall

A town near the Sunken City of Cera, which serves as a adventuring and archeology hub. Beyond that, almost nothing is known about it.

### Scarlan/Nightmother Temple

Scarlan used to be a tiny village, but it had a Temple to the Nightmother. This was the Party's first adventure, as they discovered Dave the necromancer living in the catacombs below the Temple. 

### Sibera

A decently large city in the Underdark filled with Duergar and insectoids. Duergar are underground dwarves that presumably don't like outsiders. The Miners and Party have been told to avoid the city by the Crown's Guard.

### Silverfell

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. Hobson was originally supposed to join the college as an administrator before meeting Valss.

### Springoak

A town on the Western edge of Orlon. Almost nothing is known other than Hobson is likely a wanted man thanks to Valss.

### Sunken City of Cera

The ruins of the Voedia civilization. These ruins are the most likely origin of Coil, as similar Nobility Cera models of Warforged have been discovered on delves into the city's ruins.

### Void Cave

A large cave filled with Void Crystals that was home to the Void Snail. It is about 2 days travel to the West of Filgrove. The Party killed the Void Snail, taking chunks back to create new items.

## Other Regions

### The Shard Coast

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here. Whoever put the bounty on Morenthal is in this area.

### Shareaza

Presumably a large town across the East Sea (which means it may not be on Orlon proper). It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Almost nothing is known about it otherwise.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, trecherous journeys.

## Major Events

### The War in the West

A bloody conflict presumably taking place on the western side of Orlon. According to Adokas, it is a stalemate and on pause while the artifacts are being retrieved.

### Explosion at the Vaults of Eversteel

An attack of some kind on Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It scattered dozens of extremely powerful magical artifacts across the world. The Council of E'lithia is attempting to recover them before something terrible can happen.

## Travel Network

### The Airship Viradescent Javelin

The first Airship of the campaign that takes the Party from Filgrove south to Northcliff over the course of four days. It is a large flying ship held aloft by six large Green Void Crystals. Its weaponry includes six ballistas, which can be used to attack flying or grounded enemies off of the ship. Its crew is listed in the NPC references.
