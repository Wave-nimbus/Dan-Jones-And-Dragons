# The Continent of Orlon

Not much has been revealed about the continent as a whole. Most of the Party's initial adventures take place in the North of Orlon, around Filgrove.

## Major Cities/Locations

### Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures took shape. See the Filgrove reference for more information.

### The Flesh Cave

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Relic Staff was found here and used unsucessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

## Minor Cities/Locations

### Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world/continent. The Relic Staff is one such artifact.

### Geria

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft.

### Northcliff |

A presumably floating city on account of Green Void Crystals. It is south of Filgrove, but little else is knowna bout it.

### Sibera |

A decently large city in the Underdark filled with Duergar and insectoids. Duergar are underground dwarves that presumably don't like outsiders. The Miners and Party have been told to avoid the city by the Crown's Guard.

## Other Regions

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, trecherous journeys.

## Major Events

### Explosion at the Vaults of Eversteel

An attack of some kind on Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It scattered dozens of extremely powerful magical artifacts across the world. The Relic Staff is one such artifact.
