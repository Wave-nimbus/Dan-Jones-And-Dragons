# The World of E'lithia

The name of the world for this campaign is set in. There are multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'lithia. Orlon is one such continent. Other continents include Tievenera and Djoria.

# The Continent of Orlon

Orlon is the main continent that the campaign takes place on. It is controlled by an Empire, ruled by Leofrick Ozark. Smaller regions or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Generally, the Empire is at peace with everyone, though this was not always the case.

## Visited Locations/Cities

### Filgrove |

Filgrove is where the Party spent their early days. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. See the Filgrove reference for more details.

### The Flesh Cave |

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Staff of Defilement was found here and used unsucessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

### Lafford |

A town in the Northwest of Orlon. The Flower of Rebirth, one of the 10 Artifacts, was most recently used here. The town is notable for being the headquarters of the Black Hand necromancy cult. See the Lafford reference for more details.

### Northcliff |

Northcliff is a technologically adavanced city that serves as a central hub for the search for the 10 Artifacts. It used to be home of the Champions of Virtue before they disbanded. It floats high above the ground on Green Void Crystals. Northcliff is near the Southwestern edge of Orlon. See the Northcliff reference for more details.

### Ohkross |

A village north of Northcliff. When the Party first see it, it is being raided by Bloodletter bandits. It is also the home of Everit Darwin.

#### The Mossy Castle

The inn/tavern at Ohkross run by Effy the Gnome. It is a small establishment, but the Party is welcome there.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, trecherous journeys.

## Mentioned Cities/Locations

### Ashen Highlands

A volcanic region in the Southernmost part of Orlon. The nearby volcano renders it close to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Thus, it is the likely location of the Ring of Flame, one of the 10 Artifacts.

### Blackfane |

A large and major city in central Orlon. It serves as an enormous trade and merchent hub, with nearly anything being available to buy. It appears as a massive black spire with boardwalks running out a distance from the main spire. The Emperor of E'E'lithia is also housed in this city.

### Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel |

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world of E'lithia. The Council of E'lithia has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Desert of Thorns

A large desert in Eastern Orlon. The Gauntlet of the Eye, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be somewhere in this desert.

### Dragonhold

A city somewhere in Orlon, presumably with a large population of dragons or draconic relatives. It is under lockdown until The Amber Dragon Eye, on of the 10 Artifacts, can be secured.

### Evertree

Almost nothing is known about this other than its name. Morenthal's Purging Dagger from the Chamillionare apparently comes from this tree.

### Far Reach Mountains

A mountain range that extends across most of the northern reaches of Orlon. It is most easily traversed by airship, though it houses several flying creatures including wyverns that are capable and willing ot attack such airships.

### Geria

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft.

### Maple

A town to the Southeast where Hobson's family lives. Maple Farms is a brand of wine. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Morfield

A town not too far to the south of Filgrove. It appears to be the most recent stop for the Illustrious Delight before they went to Filgrove.

### Ravenmire

A town even further North than Filgrove. Even less happens there, so almost nothing is known.

### Rycefall

A town near the Sunken City of Cera, which serves as a adventuring and archeology hub. Beyond that, almost nothing is known about it.

### Scarlan/Nightmother Temple

Scarlan used to be a tiny village, but it had a Temple to the Nightmother. This was the Party's first adventure, as they discovered Dave the necromancer living in the catacombs below the Temple. 

### Sibera

A decently large city in the Underdark filled with Duergar and insectoids. Duergar are underground dwarves that presumably don't like outsiders. The Miners and Party have been told to avoid the city by the Crown's Guard.

### Silverfell

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. That college is headed by Gregor Timbers, one of the Champions of Virtue. Hobson originally was an administrator for the college before getting his bracer with Valse. The package the bracer came in was likely originally addressed to Gregor.

### Springoak

A town on the Western edge of Orlon. Horace Devenshire is known as the Wizard of the White Tower and hails from this town. Hobson is likely a wanted man there thanks to Valse.

### Sunken City of Cera

The ruins of the Voedia civilization. These ruins are the most likely origin of Coil, as similar Nobility Cera models of Warforged have been discovered on delves into the city's ruins.

### Void Cave

A large cave filled with Void Crystals that was home to the Void Snail. It is about 2 days travel to the West of Filgrove. The Party killed the Void Snail, taking chunks back to create new items.

### Westmont |

A town in the South of Orlon. Some years ago, Arther Oathbringer reappeared with a flying castle and an army over the town. 

## Other Regions

### The Shard Coast

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here. Whoever put the bounty on Morenthal is in this area.

### Shareaza

Presumably a large town across the East Sea (which means it may not be on Orlon proper). It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Almost nothing is known about it otherwise.

### Shoriza |

A large island far off the East coast of Orlon that has strange and strong effects on magic. Many years ago, the Champions of Virtue killed a Lich here. Arther Oathbringer's castle crashed here when Valse and Orsik Frostbeard went to investigate. No expedition to the island has beens successful since. The Planar Mirror, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be there.

# The Continent of Ty'vanera |

(TEE-ven-err-ah) A continent separate from Orlon where beast tribes have gathered to form a coalition style government. Little else is known about it, including where exactly it is.

## Mentioned Towns/Locations

### Bluelake |

A town on the West edgee of Ty'vanera. The Flower of Rebirth was used & recovered here before being transfered to the Vaults of Eversteel. Other than that, nothing is known about it.

### Wildwin

A town in the center of continent of Ty'vanera. The Wand of Chaos, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be here.

A bloody conflict presumably taking place on the western side of Orlon. According to Adokas, it is a stalemate and on pause while the artifacts are being retrieved.

### Explosion at the Vaults of Eversteel

An attack of some kind on Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It scattered dozens of extremely powerful magical artifacts across the world. The 10 most powerful artifacts are being hotly persued by the Council of E'lithia. 

## Travel Network

### The Airship Viradescent Javelin |

The first Airship of the campaign that takes the Party from Filgrove south to Northcliff over the course of four days. It is a large flying ship held aloft by six large Green Void Crystals. Its weaponry includes six ballistas, which can be used to attack flying or grounded enemies off of the ship. The ship is at the Party's disposal for their hunt for the 10 Artifacts. Its crew is listed in the NPC references.

### Teleporation Circles |

A series of Teleportation Circles allow for much longer and much quicker travel between cities. The Party has yet to use any for direct travel yet. Known Teleportation Circles are found within: *Blackfane*, *Filgrove*, and *Northcliff*
