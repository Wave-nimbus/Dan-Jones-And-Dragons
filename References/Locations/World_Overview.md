# The World of E'lythia

The name of the world for this campaign is set in. There are multiple continents, overseen by the Council of E'lythia. Orlon is one such continent. Other continents include Ty'vanera and Djoria.

# The Continent of Orlon

Orlon is the main continent that the campaign takes place on. It is controlled by an Empire, ruled by Leofrick Roseark. Smaller regions or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Generally, the Empire is at peace with everyone, though this was not always the case.

## Visited Locations/Cities

### Ashen Highlands 

A volcanic region in the Southernmost part of Orlon. The nearby volcano renders it close to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Thus, it was the location of the Ring of Flame, one of the 10 Artifacts.

### Filgrove 

Filgrove is where the Party spent their early days. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. See the Filgrove reference for more details.

### The Flesh Cave 

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Staff of Defilement was found here and used unsuccessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

### Lafford 

A town in the Northwest of Orlon. The Flower of Rebirth, one of the 10 Artifacts, was most recently used here. The town is notable for being the headquarters of the Black Hand necromancy cult. See the Lafford reference for more details.

### Mt. Fiorno 

A town in th south of Orlon within the Ashen Highlands. The Ring of Flame was discovered by a resident before being taken to the nearby Voscorie Bog. See the Mt. Fiorno reference for more details.

### Northcliff 

Northcliff is a technologically advanced city that serves as a central hub for the search for the 10 Artifacts. It used to be home of the Champions of Virtue before they disbanded. It floats high above the ground on Green Void Crystals. Northcliff is near the Southwestern edge of Orlon. See the Northcliff reference for more details.

## Mentioned Cities/Locations

### Blackfane 

A large and major city in central Orlon. It serves as an enormous trade and merchant hub, with nearly anything being available to buy. It appears as a massive black spire with boardwalks running out a distance from the main spire. The Emperor of E'lythia is also housed in this city.

### Brightcoin

A major city on the continent of Orlon. It is home to the Vaults of Eversteel, though little else is known about it. It is ruled by a king named Rylen Lendsborough.

### Dragonhold

A city somewhere in Orlon, presumably with a large population of dragons or draconic relatives. It is under lockdown until The Amber Dragon Eye, one of the 10 Artifacts, can be secured.

### Duskern

A town in central Orlon that is currently dealing with an outbreak of Ashen Rot. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Emerald Sea 

A sea that is presumably somewhere off of Orlon's coast. Preston Fitzclarance believes that one of the 10 Artifacts is located in or around the Sea.

### Fywood

A town where Sionia is originally from. Though on the Orlon continent, they are officially unaligned with the Empire. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Maple 

A town to the Southeast where Hobson's family lives. Maple Farms is a brand of wine. Ruins of the Voedia civilization are nearby. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Rycefall

A town near the Sunken City of Cera, which serves as an adventuring and archeology hub. Beyond that, almost nothing is known about it.

### The Shard Coast 

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here. Whoever put the bounty on Morenthal is in this area. Ruins of the Voedia civilization are nearby. Despite being a large area, it is considered a single city. 

### Silverfell 

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. That college is headed by Gregor Timbers, one of the Champions of Virtue. Hobson originally was an administrator for the college before getting his bracer with Valse. The package the bracer came in was likely originally addressed to Gregor.

### Sunken City of Cera

The ruins of the Voedia civilization. These ruins are the most likely origin of Coil, as similar Nobility Cera models of Warforged have been discovered on delves into the city's ruins.

### Vaults of Eversteel 

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the world of E'lythia. The Council of E'lythia has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Wellmore Keep 

A structure near Silverfell where a mysterious mansion has reappeared. Almost nothing else is known about the keep itself.

### Westmount 

A town in the South of Orlon. Some years ago, Arthur Oathbringer reappeared with a flying castle and an army over the town. It houses a magical school where a powerful Dragonborn escaped from.

## Other Regions

### Shariza

A large island far off the East coast of Orlon that has strange and strong effects on magic. It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Many years ago, the Champions of Virtue killed a Lich here. Arthur Oathbringer's castle crashed here when Valse and Orsik Frostbeard went to investigate. No expedition to the island has been successful since, including Biri's. The Planar Mirror, one of the 10 Artifacts, is confirmed to be there.

### Shara's Tomb

A tomb presumably for someone named Shara. Almost nothing else is known about it, including its global location. The Gauntlet of the Eye is believed to originate from within it.

# The Continent of Ty'vanera 

(TY-ven-err-ah) A continent separate from Orlon where beast tribes have gathered to form a coalition style government. Little else is known about it, including where exactly it is.

## Mentioned Towns/Locations

### Whitecrest 

A major city on the Western edge of Ty'Vanera. It houses The Citadel, a knowledge hub of the world. Lady Belle and Vindilay made contact with Hobson here first.

### Wildwin 

A town in the center of the continent of Ty'vanera. The Wand of Chaos, one of the 10 Artifacts, is believed to be here. However, the land is cursed, so the Council of E'lythia's drones cannot survey the area.

A continent separate from Orlon. Almost nothing is known about the continent other than it's name and existence.

## Mentioned Towns/Locations

## Travel Network

### The Airship Viridescent Javelin  

The first Airship of the campaign that takes the Party from Filgrove south to Northcliff over the course of four days. It is a large flying ship held aloft by six large Green Void Crystals.

Its crew is listed in the NPC references.
