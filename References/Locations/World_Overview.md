# The Continent of Orlon 

Not much has been revealed about the continent as a whole. It is controlled by an Empire. Smaller sections or towns on the continent may be under control of Dukes. Most of the Party's initial adventures take place in the North of Orlon, around Filgrove.

## Major Cities/Locations

### Filgrove 

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures took shape. See the Filgrove reference for more information.

## Minor Cities/Locations

### Brightcoin

A major city on the continent of Orlon. It is home to the Vaults of Eversteel, though little else is known abou it.

### Geria 

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft.

### Ravenmire 

A town even further North than Filgrove. Even less happens there, so almost nothing is known.

### Scarlan/Nightmother Temple 

Scarlan used to be a tiny village, but it had a Temple to the Nightmother. This was the Party's first adventure, as they discovered Dave the necromancer living in the catacombs below the Temple. 

### Springoak 

A town on the Western edge of Orlon. Almost nothing is known other than Hobson is likely a wanted man thanks to Valse.

### Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack and explosion caused several of such artifacts to be spread around the continent. A recovery effort is underway. 

## Other Regions

### The Shard Coast 

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here.

### Shariza 

Presumably a large town across the East Sea (which means it may not be on Orlon proper). It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Almost nothing is known about it otherwise.

### The Underdark 

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region.

## Major Events

### Explosion at the Vaults of Eversteel

An attack of some kind on Brightcoin and the Vaults themselves. It scattered dozens of extremely powerful magical artifacts across the continent/world.
