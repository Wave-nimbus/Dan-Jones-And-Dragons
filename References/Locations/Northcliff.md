## Northcliff 

Northcliff is a large, technologically advanced city in the Southwest of Orlon. It floats high above the surrounding land on enormous Green Void Crystals, but it is yet anchored to the ground below. The city serves as the current headquarters for the search of the 10 Artifacts scattered due to the Explosion at Brightcoin. Surrounding the city is a powerful barrier that blocks most physical objects if needed. The city is divided into several districts, but more specific locations include:

### Blezulbee Farms 

A farm owned by Macadoo Blezulbee in Northcliff's Old Town. It is currently housing a barn that contains a combat robot. The robot was originally commissioned for farming, but the inventors took it too far.

### Champion's Hall 

Once the headquarters of the Champions of Virtue, this massive mansion has been turned into a museum dedicated to them. A massive painting depicting the Champions and their names is a centerpiece of the museum's collection.

### Crater Mines

The unofficial designation for the mines below Northcliff. Most of Northcliff's mining occurs here. They were having issues with rust monsters eating the iron in the mines. The Party managed to clear out all the monsters to get the mine functioning again.

### The Crossed Swords 

Adokus's dojo is within the Eastern entertainment district. He runs various (legal) sparing and sportsbetting operations within. He also appears to be much more relaxed at his dojo than in any other formal situations.

### Coryfair River

The river (and lake of the same name) is where most of Northcliff's main fresh water comes from. It is fairly clear and clean, but with little to no fish in it.

### Crystal Circle

Situated in the Northwest of Northcliff, this serves as the center of the religious district. Smaller individual temples to the Divine Nine are found around here.

### Forge & Forestry

"Fantasy Costco" is in the Western trade district. It is run by a dwarf and elf couple. The Dwarf is named Riona, and the elf is currently unnamed. Weapon upgrades along with other gear can be purchased for a lot of money and time.

### The Grand Library

Northcliff's main library is four or five stories tall filled with knowledge and books. If the Party desires to learn any information about anything, this is probably their best bet.

### Moeb's Pawn Shop

A pawn shop in the Western trade district run by Moeb and frequented by Estevan. Any scrap metals or useless artifacts could potentially be sold here. 

### North Cliff University (NCU)

A university that exists somewhere in Northcliff for higher education. Marmitull of the Airship Viridescent Javelin is an alumn of NCU. Kasma used to teach at NCU.

## Obliteration Amphitheatere 

A large cinema-like amphitheatere where an annual combat tournament is held. Gelnek will be participating in that tourney, which makes the Amphitheatere prepare for weeks ahead of the event.

## O'Brien's Mill

A small inn and tavern in the old district of Northcliff. It is home to more unsavory types should the Part be willing to do dirtier jobs. It has a password: three knocks and the phrase "The corn chowder is about ready."

### The Shattered Shield 

Found in the East of the city, this is the inn that the Flower Crowns stay at while in Northcliff. It is run by the 4-armed Arjun Moon. While it is not quite as cozy as the Brass Squid, it is nicer and fancier than the inn in Filgrove.

### The Spire 

An enormous tower in the center of the city that amplifies the power of magic. It is the power source of the magical barrier surrounding Northcliff. It also serves as the meeting place for the Council of E'lythia members to coordinate the search. The tower's power allows for scrying spells to reach far beyond what an ordinary person could create.

### The Suggestive Squeeze 

A location in a seedier part of the Entertainment District. It is presumably a saloon of some kind that is frequented by Pancreas Hornsfarrow.
