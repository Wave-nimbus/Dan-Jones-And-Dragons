## Northcliff 

Northcliff is a large, technologically advanced city in the Southwest of Orlon. It floats high above the surrounding land on enormous Green Void Crystals, but it is yet anchored to the ground below. The city serves as the current headquarters for the search of the 10 Artifacts scattered due to the Explosion at Brightcoin. Surrounding the city is a powerful barrier that blocks most physical objects if needed. The city is divided into several districts, but more specific locations include:

### Blezelbee Farms |

A farm owned by Makido Blezelbee in Northcliff's Old Town. It is currently housing a barn that contains a combat robot. The robot was originally comissioned for farming, but the inventors took it too far.

### Champion's Hall |

Once the headquarters of the Champions of Virtue, this massive mansion has been turned into a museum dedicated to them. A massive painting depicting the Champions and their names is a centerpiece of the museum's collection.

### Crater Mines

The unofficial designation for the mines below(?) Northcliff. Most of Northcliff's mining occurs here. They are currently having issues with some creature that eats metal and iron, causing the iron supply to be threatened.

### The Crossed Swords |

Adokus's dojo is within the Eastern entertainment district. He runs various (legal) sparing and sportsbetting operations within. He also appears to be much more relaxed at his dojo than in any other formal situations.

### Coryfair River |

The river (and lake of the same name) is wheree most of Northcliff's main fresh water comes from. It is fairly clear and clean, but with little to no fish in it.

### Crystal Circle |

Situated in the Northwest of Northcliff, this serves as the center of the religious district. Smaller individual temples to the Divine Nine are found around here.

### Forge & Forestry |

"Fantasy Costco" is in the Western trade district. It is run by a dwarf and elf couple. The Dwarf is named Riona, and the elf is currently unnamed. Weapon upgrades along with other gear can be purchased for a lot of money and time.

### The Grand Library |

Northcliff's main library is four or five stories tall filled with knowledge and books. If the Party desires to learn any information about anything, this is probably their best bet.

### Mobe's Pawn Shop |

A pawn shop in the Western trade district run by Mobe and frequented by Estavan. Any scrap metals or useless artifacts could potentially be sold here. 

### North Cliff University (NCU) |

A university that exists somewhere in Northcliff for higher education. Marmatool of the Airship Viradescent Javelin is an alumn of NCU. Casma used to teach at NCU.

## Opal Circlet

A hole-in-the-wall jewelery shop run by a Gnome named Velina. Almost any type of jewelery can be bought here, including pieces crafted from Void Crystals.

## O'Brian's Mill

A small inn and tavern in the old district of Northcliff. It is home to more unsavory types should the Part be willing to do dirtier jobs. It has a password: three knocks and the phrase "The corn chowder is about ready."

### The Shattered Shield |

Found in the East of the city, this is the inn that the Flower Crowns stay at while in Northcliff. It is run by the 4-armed Arjuun Moon. While it is not quite as cozy as the Brass Squid, it is nicer and fancier than the inn in Filgrove.

### The Spire |

An enormous tower in the center of the city that amplifies the power of magic. It is the power source of the magical barrier surrounding Northcliff. It also serves as the meeting place for the Council of E'lithia members to coordinate the search. The tower's power allows for scrying spells to reach far beyond what an ordinary person could create.

### Temple of the Dawnmaiden |

One of the temples dedicated to a specific member of the Nine found in the Crystal Circle. This one is for Ophena the Dawnmaiden. Its stained glass windows and statues depicting Ophena are a hallmark of its architecture.

### Temple of the Nine |

The focal point of the Northwestern religion district, this gigantic temple is dedicated to all the members of the Divine Nine. 

### The Tipsy Golem |

A smaller tavern in the trade district. It is home to a fan group of the Champions that meet monthly to hang out and geek over the Champions.
