## First Edition Tankard

A fancy tankard that was one of the original decorated tankards from the Brass Squid. The Party is gifted this by Gavel the Brass Squid Tavernkeep to remind them of where they all started. Gelnek traded one of his mace maraccas for it.

## Soul Egg

A catalope sized amber egg that has mysterious runes and carvings on it. Cross-checking the runes with Everit Darwin's other work seems to imply that a soul may be trapped inside of it. Said soul was Everit's, and at his request, Morenthal destroyed the egg, freeing Everit's soul.
