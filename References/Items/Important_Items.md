## Flower of Rebirth/Seed of the Flower of Rebirth 

One of the 10 Artifacts from Brightcoin. It blooms once every 100 years, leaving behind a seed. It is capable of reviving any creature provided the resurrection is not interrupted, leaving behind an enormous Divine magic signature. This signature was last noted near Lafford. The seed is about pearl sized, glows white, and gives off a faint heat.

## Ioun Stone of Reserve

A purple magical stone used by casters to hold additional spells in reserve. It was treasure recovered from the Eyedra's lair, though it has yet to be given to a Player permanently yet.

## Soul Orb

A pristine pearl that Karashala gave to Trilby so he could give it to Feyli. Once given, it is absorbed into her hand. Karashala extracts it in exchange for a Lycanthrope cure. The extraction took Feyli's Soul with it. When Feyli was reincarnated, the soul of Gelnek was placed inside it instead.

## Ring of Flame

One of the Missing Artifacts. A ring that is implied to be originally owned by the Flame Tyrant. It is heavily attuned to the Plane of Fire. It was recovered off of the Eyedra within the Castle of Ol'Lui, who had used it to turn its lair into a magma flowing inferno. The ring allows for powerful magic to be cast as well as immunity to fire and heat.

## Staff of Defilement 

A powerful artifact that originally came from Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It's power was used by the Brood Mother cult to create the Flesh Cave. It was successfully retrieved by the Party, and its effects are nullified by a Bag of Holding. It was one of the 10 Artifacts.
