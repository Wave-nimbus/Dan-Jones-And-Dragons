## The 10 Artifacts 

10 of the most dangerous and powerful artifacts scattered by the Explosion at Brightcoin. The Council of E'lithia is trying to recover them as soon as possible. <br>
Recovered artifacts are *The Staff of Defilement* & *The Flower of Rebirth*<br>
Unrecovered artifacts are: *The Amber Dragon Eye*, *The Gauntlet of the Eye*, *The Heart of the Keep*, *The Planar Mirror*, *The Ring of Flame*, *The Shaper of Minds*, *The Throne of Want*, and *The Want of Chaos*. 

## The First's Heart 

An artifact of the First Dead that the Midnight Lotus believe Feyli stole. Feyli, however, did not steal it to her knowledge. Recovering the Heart is key to reviving the First Dead.

## Flower of Rebirth/Seed of the Flower of Rebirth 

One of the 10 Artifacts from Brightcoin. It blooms once every 100 years, leaving behind a seed. It is capable of reviving any creature provided the resurrection is not interrupted, leaving behind an enormous Divine magic signature. This signature was last noted near Lafford. The seed is about pearl sized, glows white, and gives off a faint heat.

## Ioun Stone of Reserve

A purple magical stone used by casters to hold additional spells in reserve. It was treasure recovered from the Eyedra's lair, though it has yet to be given to a Player permenantly yet.

## Perfect Pearl 

A pristine pearl that Karshala gave to Trilby so he could give it to Feyli. Once given, it is absorbed into her hand. Karshala extracts it in exchange for a Lycanthrope cure. It seemed to have absorbed something from Feyli.

## Ring of Flame

One of the Missing Artifacts. A ring that is implied to be originally owned by the Flame Tyrant. It is heavily attuned to the Plane of Fire. It was last seen near Mt. Fiorno & the Rift of Fire.
