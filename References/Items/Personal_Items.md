## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karashala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Coil's Counterburst Greatsword

A greatsword with a floating piece of Void Crystal on its crossguard. It allows a single cast of Counterspell per day, using proficiency bonus for any rolls. It was crafted by Uldar of the Green Ravens.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karashala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karashala. <br>
The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks. <br>
The second card was The Tower, resulting in her sinking into her surroundings ever so slightly. <br>
The third card was The Justice, doubling the amount of gold on her person.

### Feyli's Key to Coil

An obsidian cylinder that fits into Coil's jaw. Using it on Coil will unhinge his jaw, causing Coil to enter a hyper rage state. His bites allow him to regain HP while in this rage.

A silver headband with a chunk of Void Crystal embedded inside that Uldar of the Green Ravens crafted. It grants advantage on INT saves.

### Feyli's Music Box

A seemingly ordinary Music Box that Feyli continuously forgets she has. She alone is confused by not having seen it before, despite showing to the Party multiple times.
