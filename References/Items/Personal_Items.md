## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karshala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karshala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karshala. The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks.

### Hobson's Adamantine Shortsword

A shortsword found among the personal effects of the Missing People. Originally discovered by Morenthal, it was given to Hobson for keeping, and it has since become his pact weapon. It deals Crit damage to objects.

### Hobson's Milk of the Poppy Potion

A draught of sleeping potion that was purchased at the Serpent's Flower. Hobson was potentially going to use it to avoid being possessed by Valse constantly.
