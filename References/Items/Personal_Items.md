## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karashala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karashala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karashala. <br>
The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks.
