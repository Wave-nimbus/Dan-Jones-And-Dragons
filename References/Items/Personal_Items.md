## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karshala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Coil's Counterburst Greatsword

A greatsword with a floating piece of Void Crystal on its crossguard. It allows a single cast of Counterspell per day, using proficiency bonus for any rolls. It was crafted by Uldar of the Green Ravens.

### Coil's Mantle of the Pack Lord

A hide cloak/pelt that prevents creatures from gaining advantage on attacks due to flanking. It was purchased from the Charmillionare for 800 gp.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karshala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karshala. The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks. The second card was The Tower, resulting in her sinking into her surroundings ever so slightly.

### Feyli's Music Box

A seemingly ordinary Music Box that Feyli continuously forgets she has. She alone is confused by not having seen it before, despite showing to the Party multiple times. (Such forgetful properties are refered to as "antimemetic") Horace Devinshire used it to erase some of Feyli's memories of her time with the Midnight Lotus. That erasure is complete.
