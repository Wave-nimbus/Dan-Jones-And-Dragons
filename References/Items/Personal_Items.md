## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karshala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karshala. <br>
The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks. <br>

The third card was The Justice, doubling the amount of gold on her person.
