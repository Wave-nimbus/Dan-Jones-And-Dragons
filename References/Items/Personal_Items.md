## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod 

An item purchased from Karashala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards 

An item gotten from Karashala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karashala.

### Feyli's Music Box 

A seemingly ordinary Music Box that Feyli continuously forgets she has. She alone is confused by not having seen it before, despite showing it to the Party multiple times. (Such forgetful properties are referred to as "antimemetic")

### Hobson's Adamantine Shortsword 

A shortsword found among the personal effects of the Missing People. Originally discovered by Morenthal, it was given to Hobson for keeping, and it has since become his pact weapon. It deals Crit damage to objects.

### Hobson's Milk of the Poppy Potion 

A draught of sleeping potion that was purchased at the Serpent's Flower. Hobson was potentially going to use it to avoid being possessed by Valse constantly.

### Trilby's Bag of Many Things 

A bag with unknown properties. It was gifted to Trilby by Biggleton Whippersnap with the Brass Puzzle locking the top. In turn, Trilby is supposed to give Whippersnap some items from the bag.

### Trilby's Brass Puzzle 

A deviously complex puzzle that had to be solved before Trilby could access his Bag of Many Things. After a few days, Trilby managed to crack open the puzzle (which had a DC 25 INT check).
