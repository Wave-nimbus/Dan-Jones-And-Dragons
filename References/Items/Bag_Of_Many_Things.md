# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Aquamarine Dagger

A folding pocket knife that acts as a dagger. If it is magical/special in any way, it is currently unkown. Coil currently is in possesion of this item.

## Broken Sword

A sword hilt and crossguard with most of its blade broken. Trilby gave it to Uldar who repaired it into Trilby's shortsword.

## Bronze Chalice

A nice chalice made of bronze and covered in cheap gems. Any magical properties are unknown, but it can probably be sold.

## Burning Hands Spell Scroll

A single use of the Burning Hands spell written onto a spell scroll.

## Green Dragon Scale

A scale from a Green Dragon that is larger than Trilby's fist. Dragon scales are known for their durability, so Trilby carved a Button from it and gave it to Gelnek.

## Green Ribbon

A completely ordinary but high quality green silk ribbon. It measures 10 ft long. It was attached to the hilt of Trilby's repaired shortsword.

## Green Void Crystal

A chunk of anti-gravity Green Void Crystal. It could be used to make an item ligher if needed. Trilby incorporates it into Scrubbins so any Force Billista blast can pull enemies 5 feet as well as pushing them 5 feet.

## Horn Shell

A small conical shell that does not appear to have a creature inside of it. Further usage unknown.

## Hunting Trap

A normal mechanical hunting trap used to catch small animals. It chomped on Trilby's hand when it was pulled. Feyli is given the Trap, as she is most atttuned to nature and survival.

## Jingle Bell

A silver bell that looks exactly like a classic jingle bell. Trilby immediately attaches it to the hilt of his green ribbon sword, making it a rather noisy weapon.

## Makeup Compact

A clamshell makeup compact with pale skin toned foundation inside. Trilby gives it to Feyli, since she's the most likely to use it. Neither of them know what to do with it, though.

## Ship in a Bottle

A miniature ship inside of a bottle the size of an apple. While tinkering with it, Trilby accidentally breaks one of the masts on the ship. Further usage unknown.

## Torquoise Feather

A relatively large feather whose hue goes from white to torquoise at the tip. If it has any magical properties, they are unknown at the time.

## Vintage Year Wine

A Ninteen Ninteye (1990) aged wine from Maple Farms. Hobson recognized the brand, as he and his family are from Maple. Hobson currently possesses this item.

## Waterskin

A finely crafted leather waterskin. It's stitching is so intricate that symbols might be within the thread. Otherwise, it appears to be a normal waterskin.
