# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Alchemist's Fire 

A baseball sized bottle with a sealed cork filled with Alchemist's Fire. It could probably be thrown to deal acid damage to an enemy.

## Blue Crystal Shard 

A blue crystal that is not a Void Crystal. It could still be worth something, however.

## Ceramic Mask 

Presumed to be a ceramic mask. What it depicts and what it can do are completely unknown.

## Chain Necklace 

A simple necklace made of sparkly metal. As a gift, Trilby gives it to Gnaw of the Ustenki Tribe.

## Clockwork Wolf Statue 

A statue of a wolf made out of clockwork parts. What it can do and any potential functions are completely unknown.

## Combat God's Religious Symbol 

A religious symbol of some kind of combat-focused God/Goddess. It has a crossed sword and axe in front of a shield as its symbol. It is currently unused by anyone.

## Large Animal Droppings 

A handful of droppings from a large animal such as a bear. They likely have no purpose.

## Large Silver Fork 

A standard fork that is just a little too large to be comfortable. Despite having a silver color to it, the underlying metal is not valuable.

## Matchbook 

A book of regular, nonmagical matches. With it, Trilby can probably start fires without magic.

## Simple Leather Helmet 

Presumed to be a simply made helmet made of leather. Its usage is currently unknown, including if it adds an AC or not.

## Zimera Holy Symbol 

A holy symbol dedicated to Zimera, the Goddess of knowledge, the arcane, and stars. It could probably be used by a cleric or paladin if needed.
