# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Brass Cog 

A tiny brass cog that is about the size of a button. If it is magical/special in any way, it is currently unknown. Trilby tossed it inside Scrubbins soon after he pulled it.

## Burning Hands Spell Scroll 

A single use of the Burning Hands spell written onto a spell scroll. Trilby used it at the battle in Ohkross, but he managed to keep it intact. It was used and destroyed against the First's Form.

## Empty Bottle 

A sizable bottle that is completely empty. It is about the same size as the bottle for the Ship in a Bottle.

## Grappling Hook 

A metallic hook attached to 50ft of rope. It appears to be a standard grappling hook, though Trilby may have trouble wielding it.

## Pair of Marbles 

A pair of fancy marbles that were pulled out of the bag. They likely have no use other than looking cool.

## Solid Silver Goblet 

An otherwise nondescript goblet made of pure silver. It has very little decoration on the outside, as compared to the Bronze Chalice.
