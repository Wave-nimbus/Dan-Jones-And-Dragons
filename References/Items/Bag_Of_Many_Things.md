# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Green Void Crystal

A chunk of anti-gravity Green Void Crystal. It could be used to make an item ligher if needed. Trilby incorporates it into Scrubbins so any Force Billista blast can pull enemies 5 feet as well as pushing them 5 feet.

## Jingle Bell |

A silver bell that looks exactly like a classic jingle bell. Trilby immediately attaches it to the hilt of his green ribbon sword, making it a rather noisy weapon.

## Makeup Compact |

A clamshell makeup compact with pale skin toned foundation inside. Trilby gives it to Feyli, since she's the most likely to use it. Neither of them know what to do with it, though.

## Torquoise Feather |

A relatively large feather whose hue goes from white to torquoise at the tip. If it has any magical properties, they are unknown at the time.
