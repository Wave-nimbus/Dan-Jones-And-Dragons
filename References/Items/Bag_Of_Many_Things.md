# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Handaxe

A standard Handaxe. It is not otherwise magical or special in any way. It is light enough to be dual wielded and can be thrown.

## Pair of Marbles 

A pair of fancy marbles that were pulled out of the bag. They were the mysterious item Trilby tricked the pixies at Valse's statue to desire so badly.

## Two D10s

A pair of mundane d10 dice with pips on them. Rolling them has no effect. Trilby gifted these to Bifar Clemingsworth in Northcliff.
