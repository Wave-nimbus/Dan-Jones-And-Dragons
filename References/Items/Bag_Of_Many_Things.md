# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Broken Sword 

A sword hilt and crossguard with most of its blade broken. Trilby gave it to Uldar who repaired it into Trilby's shortsword.

## Bronze Chalice 

A nice chalice made of bronze and covered in cheap gems. Any magical properties are unknown, but it can probably be sold.

## Burning Hands Spell Scroll 

A single use of the Burning Hands spell written onto a spell scroll.

## Green Dragon Scale

A scale from a Green Dragon that is larger than Trilby's fist. Dragon scales are known for their durability, so Trilby carved a Button from it and gave it to Gelnek.

## Green Ribbon 

A completely ordinary but high quality green silk ribbon. It measures 10 ft long. It was attached to the hilt of Trilby's repaired shortsword.

## Green Void Crystal

A chunk of anti-gravity Green Void Crystal. It could be used to make an item lighter if needed. Trilby incorporates it into Scrubbins so any Force Ballista blast can pull enemies 5 feet as well as pushing them 5 feet.

## Hunting Trap 

A normal mechanical hunting trap used to catch small animals. It chomped on Trilby's hand when it was pulled. Feyli is given the Trap, as she is most attuned to nature and survival.

## Vintage Year Wine 

A Nineteen Ninteye (1990) aged wine from Maple Farms. Hobson recognized the brand, as he and his family are from Maple. Hobson currently possesses this item.

## Waterskin 

A finely crafted leather waterskin. It's stitching is so intricate that symbols might be within the thread. Otherwise, it appears to be a normal waterskin.
