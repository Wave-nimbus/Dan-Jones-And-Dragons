# Pulls from Trilby's Bag of Many Things

## Brass Cog 

A tiny brass cog that is about the size of a button. If it is magical/special in any way, it is currently unknown. Trilby tossed it inside Scrubbins soon after he pulled it.

## Bronze Chalice 

A nice chalice made of bronze and covered in cheap gems. Any magical properties are unknown, but it can probably be sold.

## Burning Hands Spell Scroll 

A single use of the Burning Hands spell written onto a spell scroll. Trilby used it up against the First's Form.

## Empty Bottle 

A sizable bottle that is completely empty. It is about the same size as the bottle for the Ship in a Bottle.

## Grappling Hook 

A metalic hook attached to 50ft of rope. It appears to be a standard grappling hook, though Trilby may have trouble weilding it.

## Hunting Trap

A normal mechanical hunting trap used to catch small animals. It chomped on Trilby's hand when it was pulled. Feyli is given the Trap, as she is most atttuned to nature and survival.

## Pair of Marbles 

A pair of fancy marbles that were pulled out of the bag. They likely have no use other than looking cool.

## Ship in a Bottle 

A miniature ship inside of a bottle the size of an apple. While tinkering with it, Trilby accidentally breaks one of the masts on the ship. Further usage unknown.

## Solid Silver Goblet 

An otherwise nondescript goblet made of pure silver. It has very little decoration on the outside, as compared to the Bronze Chalice.
