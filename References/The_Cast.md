## Coil the Beast Barbarian (He/Him)

### Played by Saren (They/Them)
</span>
A Warforged with the head of jackal whose jaws are often locked up tight. Serves as the Party's greatest muscle and shield. Protective of all members of the Party, especially Feyli. Prefers to use his claws and mouth in combat, but carries a large sword as well for massive cleaving.

## Feyli the Circle of the Stars Druid (She/Her)

### Played by Nichole (She/Her)
</span>
A tanned Tiefling with branch-like horns adorned with flowers and a tail wrapped in thorns. She has purple hair and an outfit suggesting an affinity for nature. She is a part of the Midnight Lotus with a crystal necklace to prove it. Enjoys other people's drama so long as nobody gets physically hurt. She is running away from the Black Hand cult, which she used to be a part of.

## Gelnek the Valor Bard (He/Him)

### Played by Jocat (He/Him)
</span>
A heavy set Goblin carrying a large drum and mace maracas. If it weren't for his green skin, he could easily be mistaken for a gangly dwarf. Declared to be double leader of the Party after defeating Feyli and Morenthal in an arm wrestling contest. Follows Aether the Breaker, and his tribe is the O'stanke.

## Hobson Bunce the Custom Warlock (He/Him)

### Played by Dan Floyd (He/Him)
</span>
A Halfling who looks like Ernie from Sesame Street. Has some light leather armor and a silver bracer. His homebrewed patron is Valse, and the two are on a mission to get Valse a statue. Hobson and Valse don't exactly know what's going on most of the time, so they follow the Party happily. Valse can also take control of Hobson if needed.

## Morenthal the Assassin Rogue (He/They)

### Played by Gamb (He/They)
</span>
A Drow that hasn't quite warmed up to the Party quite yet. He is part of the Bloodletters bounty hunter/assassin group, though his past is shrouded in mystery. He wears black and leather, serving as the traditional edgy rogue. His protectiveness for Feyli has gotten him a bounty on his head as well.

## Trilby the Artillerist Artificer (He/Him)

### Played by Barry (He/Him)
</span>
A soft, pampered Human who is both brilliant and laughably weak at the same time. The Party is most willing to protect this man and his Eldritch Cannon named Scrubbins. Trilby has very little experience with the world outside of Filgrove, so many of the Party's experiences are shockers to him and his sense of justice in the world.
